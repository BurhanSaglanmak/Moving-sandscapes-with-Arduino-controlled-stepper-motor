You can directly connect the step motor circuit I designed for Arduino control according to the schematic and upload the code;
it will start working right away. You can speed up or slow down the motor by changing the delay parameter in the code. The code runs directly, no need for anything extra.

# The equipment I used:

- Arduino Uno
- 28BYJ-48 5v Step Motor
- Step Motor Driver
- 3D printer outputs
- One bearing (for smoother rotation)
- Besides the 3D printer outputs, I added an extra plastic part because the center of gravity remains high.

If you also use 3D parts, I'd like to add a small note: the gear connected to the step motor is a bit small;
you can update it to make it slightly thicker. Also, for better balance in the casing, you can extend it from the sides (right and left wings).
This way, it will be more stable, and you won't need to use an extra plastic piece like I did :) Cheers!
